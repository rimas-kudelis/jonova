# Jonova

Jonova is a contemporary sans-serif font especially suitable for Lithuanian text with stressed letters having acute, grave or tilde accent marks. Many other phonetic marks, special Lithuanian ideograms and heraldic symbols are also provided. Special care has been taken to enhance the quality of letterforms when displayed on the computer screen, ensuring that Jonova is highly legible at small sizes whether displayed on the screen or in print. The characters were hand-instructed by leading hinting expert Jonas Vaiƒçiulis. This typeface is ideal for use in extended text settings such as books, dictionaries, periodicals and office documents.

Jonova started out as a commercial product at [Fotonija](https://www.fotonija.lt) in around 2005, but has been open-sourced in 2024 with their permission. Initially built in FontLab and kerned using VOLT, it's now a [UFO](https://unifiedfontobject.org/)-based project, with binaries built by GitHub Actions.

## TODO

See [issues](https://github.com/rimas-kudelis/jonova/issues).

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/rimas-kudelis/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://rimas-kudelis.github.io/jonova/.

Fontbakery produces so many of them! I guess I'll leave it up for later to decide which ones to show.
